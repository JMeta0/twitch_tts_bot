# BezioBot for Twitch.tv - self hosted TTS solution with self created voice model.
To create voice model I used https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS using VITS tts model.

- Requires ffmpeg.exe to exist in directory or in PATH

- Requires sounds in wav format to exist in sounds directory (no subfolders)

- Requires TTS Server running on http://localhost:5002
